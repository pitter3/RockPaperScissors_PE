## Context:
This is my final project of Mod 1 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given ~1 week to create this project from scratch using a provided comp found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Solidify understanding of DRY JavaScript and event delegation.
- Understand the difference between the data model and how it displays on the DOM.
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems and solve things step by step.

## Wins:
- Project was completed successfully with DRY JavaScript.
- Code follows SRP principles to the best of my ability.
- Utilized a handful of new coding techniques such as whitespace, createElement, and appendChild.
- Planning out the project from wireframe to finish was very rewarding.
- Code was refactored several times throughout, utilizing strategies we learned from last weeks lecture.

## Challenges:
- innerHTML gave me some issues when I first tried to create the "CHANGE GAME" button, but on my second attempt I was able to resolve the issue.
- Fixing bug related to the DOM was tricky, I had some functions that weren't being used at all that were causing a headache, as I thought these were the problem functions, but working on them was literally doing nothing since they weren't being used.
- Refactoring code after it is already working feels like you are taking one step fowards and two steps back sometimes.
- A handful of bugs required me to declare global variables to fix, I couldn't find a cleaner way to fix these issues.
- Time. Management. There were a handful of things going on for me this weekend and striking a balance proved very diffiuclt.
- Following the Git Workflow was at times challenging with my time contraints this weekend, I still did the best I could!
- Getting some images to display on GitHub pages was very difficult as I didn't realize case sensitivity is a factor.
